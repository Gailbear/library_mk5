            <p>
                Follow these steps to start the Tabletop Library server.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Copy the whole folder containing the Library, as is, to the desktop of a laptop running Windows 7 or later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Double click the "start.bat" file. (One console window will open.) The window will
                    tell you about another window that's about to open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press any key ONCE to continue. (The second console window will open.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter the two commands from the first console window into the second one as described.
                    See below for examples of what you'll be entering.
                    <p><em>Example commands to enter in the second console:</em></p>
                    <pre>
    cd "C:/Users/Intel/Desktop/paxTTlib/paxTTlib"
    rails s</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    After entering the second command, the server will start.
                    Wait until you see the line below before trying to access anything:
                    <pre>
    [...]
    Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000/, CTRL+C to stop</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Do <strong>NOT</strong> close either console window while the server is in use.<br/>
                Closing these windows will stop part of or all of the library!

                <li>
                    Open a new command line terminal on the server computer.

            <p>
                Q: I get some weird error message in the command line terminal when I try to <a href="#starting-the-library">start the server with the "rails s" command</a>. What am I doing wrong?
                <br/><br/>
                A: There can not be any spaces in the file path to the library package due to an issue with how some commands in the server environment are made. Check where the Library folder sits at by right-clicking on the folder and selecting "Properties". Usually this issue will occur when a username or some other path has a space in it. For example, the following path will cause an error to occur because there's a space between "Joe" and "Greathead" even though this is a valid folder/user name:
                <pre>
    C:\Users\Joe<span style="background-color: yellow;"> </span>Greathead\Desktop\tabletop_library_mk5</pre>
                In order to fix this, you need to move the whole library folder to a location that does not have spaces in it. The easiest way to do this is to move the library to the root folder on the machine's drive.
                <pre>
    C:\tabletop_library_mk5</pre>
                This will prevent the error from occuring and allow you to start the server. The location, with the exception of this issue, does not affect how the server runs.
